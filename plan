read a video of a chess game.
For each frame Find coordinates from the intersections of the straight lines.
if there are 81 coordinates this is a valid image for detecting the movement of pieces.
If it is different from the last valid image - save it.

Detection of movement of pieces:
Divide the board into squares by the coordinets of the intersections.
Using a location, identify each piece at frame 0.

for each frame
Calculate a delta of a current frame from a previous frame, both at the edges and in color on each slot.
According to the tools that were in the boxes before, update the location of the piece.
